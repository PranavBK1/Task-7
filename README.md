 Breast Cancer Classification using SVM
 Project Overview

Used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle.

Performed preprocessing, scaling, and dimensionality reduction (PCA â†’ 2D) for visualization.

Trained Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Linear and RBF kernels.

 Steps Performed

Load & Prepare Data

Removed irrelevant columns (id, Unnamed: 32).

Encoded diagnosis â†’ Malignant=1, Benign=0.

Standardized features with StandardScaler.

Reduced to 2 components using PCA for plotting decision boundaries.

Model Training

SVM with Linear Kernel.

SVM with RBF Kernel.

Visualization

Plotted decision boundaries for both kernels using 2D PCA-transformed data.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Tuned C and gamma using GridSearchCV (5-fold cross-validation).

Evaluation

Used cross_val_score for final accuracy estimation.

ðŸ“Š Results

Linear Kernel Accuracy: 0.991

RBF Kernel Accuracy:  0.982

Best Params from GridSearchCV:'C': 10, 'gamma': 0.01, 'kernel': 'rbf'
